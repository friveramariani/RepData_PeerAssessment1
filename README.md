# RepData_PeerAssessment1
This report is  part of the  project 1 of the Data Science Specializatino course, Reproducible Research. 
The data analyzed in this project originals from a personal activity monitoring device, 
which collects 5-minute intervals throughout a day. The dataset contains two months 
(i.e. October and November), and it includes the number of steps that each individual took every 5-minute interval each day.

#Variables in the dataset
* steps: Number of steps per 5-minute interval
* date: Date on which the measurement were taken
* interval: 5-minute interval identifier

"NA" corresponds to the code of missing values.

This project require the following to be performed with the assigned dataset: 

1. Determine the mean steps taken per day
2. Determine the daily patterns of steps 
3. Determine the mean steps taken per day in the absence of missing values
4. Compare daily patterns during weekdays and weeend

Packages used for this project were the following:

* reshape2
* ggplot2
* gridExtra
* knitr
